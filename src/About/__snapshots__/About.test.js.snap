        For our homeowner clients, one of the most important things we can offer, at no cost, is reliable information and resources for them to learn about hiring contractors and protecting their rights.  A contractor who is licensed, bonded and insured can often provide a high quality of workmanship and ensure adequate protections for homeowners.

          "Garth and his team at RidgeCreek has been there for me multiple times for projects (and one homeowner caused emergency) and I’ve been incredibly impressed with their responsiveness and attention to detail. Although they work on large commercial projects, they treated mine like it was just as important.  I would highly recommend them for any plumbing project."
